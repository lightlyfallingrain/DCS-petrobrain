# Todo

**Milestone status, backlog, and deferred items live in `../ROADMAP.md` (cross-subproject) and
each subproject's own `ROADMAP.md`** (`world-model/ROADMAP.md`, `aircraft-layer/ROADMAP.md`,
`body-layer/ROADMAP.md`) — not here. This file only holds User priority tasks and cross-cutting
items that don't yet belong to one subproject's roadmap. See root `ROADMAP.md`'s "Keeping this
current" note for how staleness is prevented: the `/merge` skill and the DoD agent both require
the relevant roadmap to be updated in the same push as any merge.

## User priority tasks
Prioritize any open task here over any other task in this file or roadmap files.

- [x] Route crew-text speech callouts ("tank, 12 o'clock, 3 km" style contact reports, from
  `body-layer/src/belief/speech.py`'s `render_contact_report`/`route_event`) to the in-game
  Petrobrain overlay (`aircraft-layer`'s `POST /text/push` channel, `--overlay` flag). **Done 2026-09-11:** routing mechanism wired via `_print` sink + `!!` prefix for urgent calls; CONTACT_DETECTED/REACQUIRED lifecycle content fixed to render full positional-callout format with id prefix. Part (1) live-acceptance-tested and working; Part (2) acceptance-test instructions provided for user live-DCS verification.
- [x] Create integrity audit skill, see instructions @todo/integrity-audit-skill.md — `.claude/skills/integrity-audit/SKILL.md` created 2026-09-08. 6-phase diagnostic audit (inventory → cross-file consistency → staleness → genericity leaks → duplication/dead mechanisms → memory hygiene → classify+report); never self-edits config, writes dated report to `audits/system-integrity/`.
- [x] claude workflow changes — `AGENTS.md` updated 2026-09-08: new "Auto-Advance" section (proceed through Architect → Implementer → Reviewer → (loop) → DoD without stopping between stages) and Escalation Rules extended with the local/reversible/non-material autonomy criterion. Existing `UserPromptSubmit` hook already injects "apply automatically, no user input needed" each turn — left as-is per user decision to observe first; hook mirror-update deferred unless AGENTS.md alone proves insufficient.
    - [x] move automatically to next stage in worklfows: architecht -> implementor -> reviewer -> (loop back to implementer if fixes are needed) -> DoD. If there is genuine ambiguity or need for user input/verification/perception, stop and hand to user. In normal cases, proceed to next step in workflow.
    - [x] If multiple reasonable technical approaches exist, choose one when the tradeoff is local, reversible, and does not materially affect product behavior, future architecture, dependencies, cost or risk. Escalate consequential or difficult-to-reverse decisions or where there is ambiguosity about expected behaviour.
- [x] Roadmap restructure (2026-09-10): split milestone/backlog narrative out of this file into
  root `ROADMAP.md` plus per-subproject `world-model/ROADMAP.md` / `aircraft-layer/ROADMAP.md` /
  `body-layer/ROADMAP.md`. Reason: an integrity check found this file had drifted — three merged
  milestones (BL-3, BL-4, BL-5) and one merged feature (`overlay-clock-range-summary`) were
  missing entirely, because the "update the backlog" step was easy to skip and not enforced at
  merge time. Fix applied at the process level, not just the data level: `.claude/skills/merge.md`
  and `.claude/agents/dod.md` now both require the relevant `ROADMAP.md` to be updated *in the
  same push* as any merge — see root `ROADMAP.md`'s "Keeping this current" note.

## Cross-cutting / unscoped backlog

*(None open right now — every current backlog item belongs to a subproject and lives in that
subproject's own `ROADMAP.md`. Add items here only if they don't yet belong to one, e.g. a
process/workflow change or something spanning multiple subprojects at once.)*
