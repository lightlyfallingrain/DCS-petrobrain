"""`OutgoingSpeech`, body-written templates, and `route_event` -- the
outbound half of `plans/body-layer/plan.md` §2.1/§3.6, implementing
`plans/bl5a-text-mode-crew-interaction/plan.md`'s Stage 2.

**Three templated classes** (§2.1's "Outbound: three classes of speech",
class 1 -- "Templated, body-written"): command readbacks
(`render_readback`), contact reports (`render_contact_report`, single-
contact only -- see the "No contact clustering" note below), and urgent
reactive calls (`route_event` given an `UrgentCall`). All three are final
text body itself writes; no brain is ever consulted for them.

**`route_event` is the outbound routing gate.** It checks whether the thing
it was given is an urgent call *before* anything else: an `UrgentCall`
speaks immediately, pre-empting, with no cooldown/relevance/ack machinery
touched at all (§2.1: "exempt from the cooldown, relevance-scoring and
already-mentioned suppression... pre-empt in-progress speech"). Anything
else is a `belief.events.Event` (a BL-4 lifecycle/classification/attention
event drained from `ContactStore`'s queue) -- rendered through a per-kind
template if one exists, and auto-acknowledged (`belief.tools.
acknowledge_event`) the moment it is spoken, since body has already produced
final text for it and it must not resurface through a brain's future
`poll_events`/`list_events` call (plan Risks: "Auto-acknowledge interaction
with BL-5's `poll_events`").

**Why `UrgentCall`, not a `bypass_gate` field on `belief.events.Event`.**
The plan's §3.5/§5 sketches show `bypass_gate` as a field directly on a
generic "event" object. `belief.events.Event` (BL-4) has no such field, and
`events.py` is explicitly out of the Affected Modules list for this
milestone ("BL-5a is a consumer of the existing belief surface, not a
modifier of it") -- adding an unused field to a shared, already-large
dataclass for one caller would also mean grafting a new value onto
`EventKind`'s closed literal, since no existing kind means "urgent call."
`UrgentCall` is a small, separate type instead: `route_event` accepts
`Event | UrgentCall` and dispatches on which one it got, which is the same
"check bypass first" ordering the plan describes, without touching BL-4's
event model. No real threat-detection channel exists yet (missile launch,
tracer -- unbuilt, gated on unresolved DCS-internals questions per the
plan's Risks), so `UrgentCall` is only ever constructed by
`belief.crew_console`'s `!inject-urgent` test-harness command, never by
`ContactStore.tick`.

**Which lifecycle kinds get a template.** `CONTACT_DETECTED`/`CONTACT_LOST`/
`CONTACT_REACQUIRED` render the runtime doc's literal "C17 BMP" / "C17 lost"
/ "C17 reacquired" lines (adapted to this store's own `CONTACT_<n>` id
shape). `CONTACT_CLASSIFICATION_CHANGED` gets its own short transition
line. `CONTACT_ATTENTION_CHANGED` deliberately gets **no** template --
`route_event` returns `None` for it and does not acknowledge it -- because
every attention change the crew would care about either already got a
readback (the player's own `watch`/`ignore`/... command) or is an
area-driven change not yet in scope to narrate proactively (a real,
documented gap, not an oversight: a future milestone that wants to narrate
"entering a watched area raised attention on C22" adds a template here,
it does not need to touch this module's structure).

**No contact clustering.** `render_contact_report` reads one contact's
existing `belief.tools.describe_contact` result and speaks its `summary`
verbatim -- that field is already certainty-hedged (`belief.tools.
_contact_summary`) and already appends a clock/range fragment when
`relative_now` is available, so re-deriving that logic here would duplicate
it, not improve it. §3.6's multi-contact `contact_group` worked example
(IFF, composition counts) needs data this codebase does not track yet
(`docs/concept/PETROBRAIN_RUNTIME.md` line 336: no clustering exists) --
out of scope per the plan's explicit scope cut, not an oversight."""
