"""`CrewConsole` -- the typed-input/printed-output crew session (`plans/
bl5a-text-mode-crew-interaction/plan.md` Stage 4), simulating the player-
facing text channel a real SRS transport will eventually replace (PB-7/PB-8).

**Deliberately not an extension of `belief.console.Console`.** That module's
own docstring is explicit that it is a developer debug tool -- one command
maps to one `belief.tools` call, terse and tool-shaped, not conversational.
`CrewConsole` is the opposite kind of surface: it runs typed sentences
through `belief.utterance.parse_utterance`'s grammar instead of fixed verbs,
and it speaks *proactively* (`drain_events`) in a way the debug console never
does. See the plan's "Module boundary" decision for the full argument.
Both `--console` and `--crew-text` stay available on `logger.py` side by
side (mutually exclusive with each other this milestone, per the plan's
resolved decision).

**Dispatch.** `handle_line` sends one typed line through `parse_utterance`.
A `"handled"` disposition acts directly (`belief.tools.set_attention` or
`belief.tools.describe_contact`) and speaks a body-written template
(`belief.speech.render_readback`/`render_contact_report`) -- no brain call.
Anything else (`"escalated"`) is handed to `belief.escalation.
handle_player_utterance`, which this milestone's stand-in `BrainClient`s
never turn into spoken output (see `escalation.py`'s module docstring) --
consistent with §3.5's "if the brain does nothing, body says nothing."

**`drain_events`.** Called from the same poll-loop hook point BL-2.5's
`--overlay` already uses (after each `ContactStore.tick()`), it runs every
currently-unacknowledged event through `belief.speech.route_event`. Reading
`store.unacknowledged_events` rather than tracking a separate high-water
mark works because `route_event` itself acknowledges any event it renders
a template for -- so a handled kind naturally drops out of this list on the
next call, and a kind with no template (`CONTACT_ATTENTION_CHANGED`, see
`speech.py`) is harmlessly re-checked and re-skipped every poll rather than
needing its own suppression bookkeeping here.

**`!inject-urgent <contact_id> <text...>`.** Stage 5's manual bypass_gate
proof (the plan's accepted decision: no real threat-detection channel
exists yet, so this is a clearly-labelled test harness, not a production
intent or a detector). Constructs a `belief.speech.UrgentCall` and routes it
through the same `route_event` gate the proactive path uses, demonstrating
ordering/pre-emption without pretending a real missile-launch/tracer
detector exists."""
